    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <h2>This is my test website.</h2>
    <h3>Actually, this website- file, I meant, is a notes page.</h3>
    <h4>Here is the page structure!</h4>
    <hr>
    <header><strong>Header:</strong> Just the top of the page.</header>
    <hr>
    <nav><strong>Nav:</strong> A place to put links to an off-website tab, or just links that take one to a part of the website.</nav>
    <hr>
    <main><strong>Main: </strong> A thesis, a claim, a place to put what the website's all about and stuff. An image usually would go here.</main>
    <hr>
    <article><strong>Article:</strong> A place to put images/text that relates to the reason why you typed your website for.</article>
    <hr>
    <section><strong>Section: </strong>A place to put what you think is a major part of your website.</section>
    <hr>
    <aside><strong>Aside:</strong> A place to put what you think is a major part of your website, just that it is in the side. Most likely a picture.</aside>
    <hr>
    <footer><strong>Footer:</strong> The bottom of your website's page. It could be copyright notices or social media links, whatever is considered misc. to your actual website's purpose. </footer>

    <h1 id="space-title">A Wonder From Above (Literally)</h1>
    <h2 id="space-subtitl"><em>There is more to explore than just where we reside.</em></h2>
    <h2 id="space">Space.</h2>
    <p> 
        We live on earth, where most of it are like lollipops and ice cream, but what about the things around the earth? Yeah, if you've ever looked up at the night sky, chances are that the sky is black, save for the times auroras are visible. That night sky you looked at is space, the breeding ground for <strong>everything mysterious, regular, scary, and much more.</strong> It is a complete mystery that astronomers, people that study outer space, have been trying to decode for <em>decades.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        With basic knowledge of outer space, it is evident that it outer space <em>MASSIVE</em>. Wait, no, I meant the universe is <em>MASSIVE</em>, sorry (but outer space is still <em>MASSIVE</em>). The universe is, with help of mathematitions, expanding at the rate of <strong>70 kilometers a second (70 km/s)!</strong> That is a very rapid expansion rate, but for space, we really don't know. Our best bet is that space is infinite with the expansion of the universe taking up a fixed amount of space every second (get it?). 
    </p>
    <p>
       In conclusion, the universe and outer space <strong>are all mysterious things that astronomers are trying to wrap their heads around.</strong> To this day, it is still mysterious, fascinating, and <em>MASSIVE</em>.
